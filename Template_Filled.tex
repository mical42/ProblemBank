	\begin{questions} %starts the question environment; every question should be started by \question. 

		\question Does there exist a differentiable function $g(x)$ such that $g(0)=-1$, $g(2)=4$, and $g'(x)\leq 2$ for all $x$? Find an example or explain why it doesn't exist.
		
		\begin{solution}[3.5cm] %denotes the beginning/end of a solution, with [3.5cm] specifying how much blank space to leave if \noprintanswers is put above
        		
			If such a function existed, then by MVT we would have some $c$ in the interval $(0,2)$ such that \[g'(c)=\frac{g(2)-g(0)}{2-0}=\frac{4-(-1)}2=\frac52\]
        		This is impossible since $g'(x)\leq2$ for all $x$.
		\end{solution}

        	\question Determine whether $f(x)$ satisfies the hypothesis of the mean value theorem on the given interval. If so, find all numbers $c$ in the interval so that $f(b)-f(a)=f'(c)(b-a)$.
        	\begin{parts} %If your question has several parts, after \question, use this to start a parts environment, where each part is begun by \part

        		\part $f(x)=\frac{1}{(x-1)^2}$, $[0,2]$
			\begin{solution}[3.5cm]
			No, $f$ is not continuous on $[0,2]$
			\end{solution}
        		\part $f(x)=x+\frac4x$, $[1,4]$
			\begin{solution}[3.5cm]
				$c=2$
			\end{solution}
        		\part $f(x)=4+\sqrt{x-1}$, $[1,5]$
			\begin{solution}[3.5cm]
			$c=2$
			\end{solution}
