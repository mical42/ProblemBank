The database format is:
db
db/problems
db/problems/<PROBLEM_ID>for each problem, where <PROBLEM_ID> is the PROBLEM_ID of the problem, as defined in the metadata block
db/problems/<PROBLEM_ID>/<UNIQUE_ID>.tex for each variation of a problem, where <UNIQUE_ID> is as defined in the metadata block
All images and other resources for variations of a problem are stored in that problem's directory
